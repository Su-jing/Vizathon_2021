# Vizathon 2021
Analysis of the relationship between the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and the policies in specific developing or undeveloped countries.  
Visualizations of data about the number of confirmed cases and vaccinations.  
Data used in this project is collected by 
-[Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE)](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
-[Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data)

## Outline:

**Part 1: World Overview**  
Give an overview about the cumulative number of confirmed cases and death cases in each country around the world.  
Possible type of visualization (1):  
- World map?  
- Line graph?  
- ...  

**Part 2: South Asia & Latin America**  
Analyze specific countries in these areas, because:  
- They are facing severe problems caused by COVID-19. 
- Fewer news reports and detailed analysis are about these countries.
- Uses these countries as examples to visualize how developing or underdeveloped countries have been through during COVID-19 outbreak.

What we want to analyze:
- Compare the overall trend of the epidemic for countries in South Asia and Latin America.
- Focus on similarities and differences in response measures in different countries.
- Find the policies related to COVID-19 outbreak and conclude their effect on control of the epidemic and recovery from the epidemic.
  
Several visualizations (1-3) + citations of country policy
