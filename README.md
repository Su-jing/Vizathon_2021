# Vizathon 2021

## Covid-19 Visualizations and Vulnerability Assessment
Our group chose the public health track and did challenge 2. All the code and data we use is stored in this repo.    
[Here](http://sujing.shinyapps.io/Vulnerability) is the link to our interactive app built with [Shiny from Rstudio](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).  
Thank you for using this app!
