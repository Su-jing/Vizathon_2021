# Vizathon 2021

## Covid-19 Visualizations and Vulnerability Assessment
Our group chose the public health track and did challenge 2. All the code and data we use is stored in this repo.    
[Here](https://sujing.shinyapps.io/Vulnerability/) is the link to our interactive app built with [Shiny from Rstudio](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).  
The video is in this same directory, **named representation.mp4**  
### Thank you for using this app!
